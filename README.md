# üéôÔ∏è Grammar Scoring Engine for Voice Samples

This project builds an end-to-end pipeline that takes an audio voice sample (spoken English), converts it to text using automatic speech recognition (ASR), and evaluates the grammatical correctness of the transcribed text using a transformer-based grammar scoring model.

---

## üìå Problem Statement

**Input**: Audio file of a person speaking English.  
**Output**: A grammar score (scale: 1 to 5) representing how grammatically correct the spoken text is.

---

## üöÄ Project Workflow

The complete pipeline includes the following stages:

1. **Audio Input**  
   User uploads an audio file in `.mp3`, `.wav`, or `.m4a` format.

2. **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)**  
   Using the `openai/whisper` model to convert speech to text.

3. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**  
   Using `textattack/roberta-base-CoLA`, a RoBERTa model trained on the CoLA (Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability) dataset to assess grammar acceptability.

4. **Scoring**  
   The model outputs a probability of acceptability which is scaled to a 1‚Äì5 grammar score.

5. **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** *(Optional)*  
   Converts corrected or sample text back to speech using Google Text-to-Speech (`gTTS`).
